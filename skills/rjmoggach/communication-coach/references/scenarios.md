## Usage Notes

- **Weekly practice:** Agent selects scenario from user's weakest dimension + current level
- **On-demand:** User can request specific dimension or level
- **Difficulty progression:** Only unlock next level after 3 consecutive scores ≥7 in current level
- **Repetition:** If user scores <5, offer same level different scenario
- **Real-world integration:** After completing scenario, user should try the same pattern in real communication within 48 hours
