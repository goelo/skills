# Scoring Rubrics

All dimensions scored 0-10. Scoring is opinionated and consistent, based on rhetoric (Heinrichs), vocal coaching (Love), presence research (Cuddy), and negotiation frameworks (Harvard PON).

## Clarity (0-10)

**Goal:** Receiver understands immediately, no re-reading required.

### Positive Indicators (+2 each, max 10)
- Average sentence length < 20 words
- Active voice ratio > 70%
- Structural markers present ("First," "Therefore," "In summary")
- Jargon density < 10% (technical terms / total words)
- Unique word ratio > 0.6 (vocabulary richness without redundancy)

### Negative Indicators (-1 each)
- Run-on sentences (> 30 words)
- Nested clauses (more than 2 levels deep)
- Ambiguous pronouns ("it," "this," "that" without clear antecedent)

### Scoring Examples

**Score 9:** "We need the report by Friday. It informs our Q2 budget decision. Please include revenue trends and headcount projections."
- Short sentences, clear structure, specific request

**Score 4:** "I was thinking that maybe we could potentially look at considering the idea of possibly adjusting our approach to how we might handle the situation going forward."
- Hedging, redundancy, no concrete meaning

---

## Vocal Control (Text Proxy) (0-10)

**Goal:** Speech patterns suggest confidence, pacing, minimal filler.

### Start at 10, deduct for:
- Filler phrases: "um," "like," "you know," "actually," "basically" (-1 each)
- Hedging words: "maybe," "kind of," "sort of," "I think," "probably" (-1 each)
- Qualifier stacking: "I just wanted to maybe ask if..." (-2)
- Apologizing for existence: "Sorry to bother you but..." (-2)

### Bonus (+1 each, max +3)
- Short, punchy sentences (< 15 words) in key moments
- Strong verbs (decided, built, launched vs. tried, hoped, worked on)
- Parallel structure for rhythm

### Scoring Examples

**Score 10:** "I've decided to take the role. Start date is March 1. Let's discuss transition next week."
- Direct, no fillers, strong verbs

**Score 3:** "So like, I was kind of thinking maybe we could, you know, try to actually meet up sometime if you're free?"
- Six filler words in one sentence

---

## Presence (0-10)

**Goal:** Reader/listener feels certainty, authority, groundedness.

### Positive Indicators (+2 each, max 10)
- Declarative statements vs. questions in assertions
- First-person ownership ("I decided" vs. "We thought")
- Removal of weak language ("hope," "try," "might")
- Concrete commitments with timelines
- Confident framing ("I will" vs. "I'll try")

### Negative Indicators (-2 each)
- Question marks in statements ("We should probably do this?")
- Deferring ownership ("The team felt..." when you decided)
- Minimizing language ("just a quick thought...")
- Over-explaining decisions (justification-to-statement ratio > 2:1)

### Scoring Examples

**Score 9:** "I'm not available Thursday. I can meet Monday at 2pm or Tuesday at 10am. Let me know which works."
- Direct, specific, confident

**Score 3:** "I'm not sure if I can make Thursday work? Maybe I could try to move some things around if that's helpful? What do you think?"
- Three questions, no concrete answer, seeks validation

---

## Persuasion (0-10)

**Goal:** Message compels action or belief change.

### Based on Aristotelian Rhetoric

**Ethos (Credibility) - 0-3 points:**
- Relevant credentials or experience cited
- Track record mentioned
- Authoritative sources referenced

**Pathos (Emotional Resonance) - 0-3 points:**
- Story or concrete example included
- Stakes made clear (what happens if we don't act)
- Values or identity invoked

**Logos (Logical Structure) - 0-3 points:**
- Claim clearly stated
- Evidence provided
- Reasoning connects evidence to claim

**Bonus (+1):**
- Clear call to action stated explicitly

### Scoring Examples

**Score 10:** "I've launched three products in this space (ethos). The last team that delayed their launch lost 40% market share to competitors (pathos - stakes). Our data shows early movers capture 60% of customer base (logos). We need to ship by Q2. Approve the budget this week (CTA)."

**Score 2:** "I think we should maybe do this thing because it seems good and people might like it."
- No ethos, vague pathos, no logos, no CTA

---

## Boundary Setting (0-10)

**Goal:** Decline requests, assert needs, set limits without guilt or justification.

### Positive Indicators (+points as noted, max 10)
- Direct "no" without justification (+5)
- Justification < statement length (+3)
- Clear, complete sentence (+2)
- Offering alternative if appropriate (+2, optional)

### Negative Indicators (-points as noted)
- Apologizing for boundaries (-5)
- Over-explaining or justifying (-2 per extra sentence)
- Hedging the boundary ("I don't think I can...") (-3)
- Seeking permission for your own decision (-3)

### Scoring Examples

**Score 10:** "I'm not available for that project. I can recommend two other designers."
- Direct no, helpful alternative, no apology

**Score 2:** "I'm so sorry, I really wish I could help but I'm just super swamped right now and I don't think I'd be able to give it the attention it deserves, so maybe it's better if someone else does it? I feel terrible saying no."
- Apologizes twice, over-justifies, seeks validation, hedges

---

## Modality-Specific Adjustments

Same rubrics apply, but baselines differ:

- **Email (formal):** High standards across all dimensions
- **Email (casual):** Relax vocal control, maintain clarity
- **Slack:** Filler words acceptable, prioritize clarity and directness
- **SMS:** Maximum brevity, clarity only
- **Presentation:** Maximum standards, especially persuasion and presence
- **Conversation:** More filler acceptable, focus on boundary setting and presence

---

## Important Notes

- **Scoring is comparative to baseline** - A score of 6 means "slightly above your baseline for this modality"
- **Cultural context matters** - These rubrics are based on Western professional communication norms
- **Intent vs. impact** - We score what's on the page, not what was meant
- **Improvement is relative** - A 5→7 is worth more than staying at 9
